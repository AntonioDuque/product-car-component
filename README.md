## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS3 Modules
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) - Development environment

### What I learned

It's my first layout project. I have learned how to follow a preview, how to add images, control borders,
 stylize and make it look as close as possible to a preset design

### Continued development

I'm not completely comfortable with responsive design,also what practices to follow when starting to layout.
But every day learning more and always trying to improve
